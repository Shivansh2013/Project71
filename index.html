      <p class="text-muted"></p>Aris has many clubs to choose from such as ARIS Inclusion Alliance, Art, Athletic Development & Team Building, Board Games & Puzzles, Chess, etc. There are many fun and challenging things to do in these clubs and mabye seeing some of your friends or making new friends. The mission in ARIS Inclusion Alliance is to provide a safe space for any member of the school regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion or ability. This club is geared toward students who want to learn more about themselves, cultures and groups that might differ from their own, and the challenges we all face sometimes when we feel like we don't fit in.  In our meetings, we will use video clips, short readings and open discussion to:  Raise awareness for the different groups that exist in our school;  enhance the school climate by ensuring that all students are accepted and can have a place to be themselves;  provide support to our fellow students with any challenges they may face and learn about others who are different from ourselves. Or maybe Art where students will have time to work on art projects aimed at specific skills not addressed during regular art class. We could also work on projects designed for the beautification of the school or the promotion of school events/activities.
